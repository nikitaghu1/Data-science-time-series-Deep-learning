* Univariate Time Series

Predicting stock price using historical data of a company using Neural Networks for multi-step forecasting of stockÂ price.

# General info
This project is; to implement deep learning algorithms two sequential models of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and NeuralProphet built with PyTorch to predict stock prices using time series forecasting.
# Final thoughts
The analysis of using three deep learning algorithms shows that they remain a worthy investment for the future. A qualified investor, on the other hand, should perform both external and internal business research before making an investment decision in order to obtain a full picture of the company's potential value.
